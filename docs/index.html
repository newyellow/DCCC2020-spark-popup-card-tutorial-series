        This project is a tutorial series that aims for art students who afraid of digital tools.<br />
        <br />
Each tutorial begins with something they are familiar with - a handcrafting card, which would trigger art students' interests. Then adding a target tracking AR effect to the card, make it feels like just an extended part of the card making. Willing to break their defensive mind wall against the digital tools.<br />

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
I've giving digital workshops for the X Colledge Program at National Chengchi University for a few years.<br />
<br />
The students in my class are usually from art backgrounds. They have art skills but rejecting to learn new media tools. So I was wondering is there a way to design the workshop to attract their interests.<br />
<br />
This year I participated in an interactive pop-up book project, so I start thinking about designing an AR pop-up workshop with Spark AR Studio.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, this project is the result!<br />

<h2>What it does</h2>
The tutorial series is a combination of three different AR pop-up card project. Each project teaches different fundamentals of Spark AR Studio.<br />
<br />
Project A - Snowman teaches the very basics. Like how to set up the tracker image, how to add a plane, how to add custom images ... etc. The tutorial is a very detailed step by step guide with screenshots for the Spark AR Studio newbies.<br />
<br />
Project B - Wood House teaches more advanced topics. Like the layering, the materials, and how to do the masking.<br />
<br />
Project C - Xmas Tree encourages students to play with 3D. In the tutorial we let the student composite a 3d bench with many 2d planes, give them a feeling of how a 3d modeling tool usually likes. By using only 2d planes, which the students are less afraid of, this may be the start for their 3d learning journey.<br />

<h2>How I built it</h2>
I first designed the paper model and then build an AR solution onto it. These three projects are somehow related to my previous works. Like the Wedding Card Project, the Tiny Workshop Project, and the Snowflakes Book Project.<br />

<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>
My paper architecture friend is busy while I'm working on this project. So I have to make the model from scratch. Also, because this project is open source, I have to paint all the textures, which cost the most of my time. But with some help from my friend, I can finally make paper models! (thank him for the consulting while he's still busy!)<br />
<br />
And English writing is also kinda challenging for a non-native speaker. So many words to type ... :P<br />

<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>
I think I made an interesting tutorial series, and I love all three paper project results! Very Happy :D<br />

<h2>What I learned</h2>
I learned and practiced paper handcrafting, and painting with iPad procreate during the making of this series. I am close to becoming an artist, which is what I would like to be!<br />
<br />
And also, I realized writing a tutorial really takes time. Thanks to everyone who spent time writing free tutorials online. Thank you, guys!<br />

<h2>What's next for It's Now Winter -- AR Pop-up Card Tutorial Series</h2>

The journey is just the beginning. I think I would develop more and more AR pop-up card with my paper engineer friend. And willing to publish more tutorials in the future.
