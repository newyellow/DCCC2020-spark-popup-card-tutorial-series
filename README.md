## Intro
It is a tutorial series that aims for art students who afraid of digital tools.

Each tutorial begins with something they are familiar with - a handcrafting card, which would trigger art students' interests. Then adding a target tracking AR effect to the card, make it feels like just an extended part of the card making. Willing to break their defensive mind wall against the digital tools.

## Inspiration

I've giving digital workshops for the X Colledge Program at National Chengchi University for a few years.

The students in my class are usually from art backgrounds. They have art skills but rejecting to learn new media tools. So I was wondering is there a way to design the workshop to attract their interests.

This year I participated in an interactive pop-up book project, so I start thinking about designing an AR pop-up workshop with Spark AR Studio.

So, this project is the result!

## What it does

The tutorial series is a combination of three different AR pop-up card project. Each project teaches different fundamentals of Spark AR Studio.

Project A - Snowman teaches the very basics. Like how to set up the tracker image, how to add a plane, how to add custom images ... etc. The tutorial is a very detailed step by step guide with screenshots for the Spark AR Studio newbies.

Project B - Wood House teaches more advanced topics. Like the layering, the materials, and how to do the masking.

Project C - Xmas Tree encourages students to play with 3D. In the tutorial we let the student composite a 3d bench with many 2d planes, give them a feeling of how a 3d modeling tool usually likes. By using only 2d planes, which the students are less afraid of, this may be the start for their 3d learning journey. 

## How I built it

I first designed the paper model and then build an AR solution onto it. These three projects are somehow related to my previous works. Like the [Wedding Card Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCbqhDs6pFA), the [Tiny Workshop Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIpQJMh4Dl4), and the [Snowflakes Book Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX640eWSZO0).

## Challenges I ran into

My paper architecture friend is busy while I'm working on this project. So I have to make the model from scratch. Also, because this project is open source, I have to paint all the textures, which cost the most of my time. But with some help from my friend, I can finally make paper models! (thank him for the consulting while he's still busy!)

And English writing is also kinda challenging for a non-native speaker. So many words to type ... :P

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I think I made an interesting tutorial series, and I love all three paper project results! Very Happy :D

## What I learned

I learned and practiced paper handcrafting, and painting with iPad procreate during the making of this series. I am close to becoming an artist, which is what I would like to be!

And also, I realized writing a tutorial really takes time. Thanks to everyone who spent time writing free tutorials online. Thank you, guys!

## What's next for It's Now Winter -- AR Pop-up Card Tutorial Series

The journey is just the beginning. I think I would develop more and more AR pop-up card with my paper engineer friend. And willing to publish more tutorials in the future.
